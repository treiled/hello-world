# hello-world
Hey, totally new to GitHub. I'm very keen to learn everything. Have a great day!

Brutalism, the architectural style that proves that even concrete can have an edgy sense of fashion. It's like the rebellious teenager of the architectural world, refusing to conform to sleek and shiny norms.

Right now i'm doing many courses online so I won't have much time to work on my own projects for a minute but im excited to turn ideas into reality

Today I am finishing a course at freecodecamp.org about Data Analysis

They have given me a couple Projects that I will be studying about in the next few days.

Learning "Python for Everybody" by Dr. Chuck Severance and the University of Michigan. I am currently 4 and half hours in. I have re-recreated some of the code so far.
